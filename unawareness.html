		<b>When signing up</b> to Facebook, a new privacy policy automatically allows the site to track your activity, even after you’ve left the website. 
		<a href= "http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-signs-users-up-to-privacy-policy-that-allows-it-to-track-you-everywhere-on-the-internet-10022530.html" style="text-decoration: none">(http://www.independent.co.uk <i>Griffin, Andrew</i>)</a>

		This data collector is problematic because it's harder to find out what information Facebook collects about you. Also users have no control over what happens to the information from their user history, for example if it's in any way sold to a third party. By giving you the opportunity to hide ads based on information collected outside of Facebook, they give you the illusion of being in control. The problem with this is that the data is collected either way, you just don't get to see the effect of it anymore.<br><br>

		<b>Facebook buys information</b> about American users from some other companies. For example, the information from membership cards for food chains and airlines. That way Facebook can show ads based on interests and habits they can’t collect online. <a href= "http://www.nrk.no/ytring/facebook-ser-deg-1.11869480" style="text-decoration: none">(http://www.nrk.no <i>Myrstad, Finn</i>)</a>

		<b>To collect information</b> about users and the users activity on the web, Facebook often use cookies. <q>Technologies like cookies, pixel tags, device or other indentifiers and local storage are used to deliver, secure, and understand products, services, and ads, on and off the Facebook Services</q> <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/help/cookies/update" style="text-decoration: none">(http://www.facebook.com)</a>, it says on their website under <i>Help Center.</i> For example, the like button allows Facebook to track all visitors of the site, whether they click it or not. This is beacause they use an iframe to display the button, which contains a complete web page from Facebook. <br><br>

		<b>By accepting</b> the terms and conditions to Facebook’s privacy policy, Facebook can sell information about you to commercial sites and other companies. Even though Facebook state that <q>We only provide data to our advertising partners or costumers after we have removed your name and any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people’s data in a way that it no longer personally identifies you</q> people’s privacy is still affected. <a href= "http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2013/08/31/new-facebook-policies-sell-your-face-and-whatever-it-infers/" style="text-decoration: none">(http://www.forbes.com <i>Kosner, Anthony Wing</i>)</a>
